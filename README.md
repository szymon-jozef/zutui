##### Wouldn't you rather stay in your terminal? Everyone loves terminals...

##### At least I did.

# So here we go!

# Usage
### 1. Download:

pip install git+https://github.com/shv187/zutui.git
```
### 2. Start:
```
zutui
```
### 3. Enjoy :)

# Bindings
`j` - Down

`k` - Up

`enter` - See partial grades info

`ctrl`+`q` - Quit

# Sidenotes
- config is stored @ `~/zutui/config.json`
- so are `grades_cache.json`
- in plaintext.....

##### As of right now I don't see any MUCH better way.

##### I mean we could simply encrypt and decrypt it during runtime, but... does it really make it any more secure?

##### And we can't really store it in any form of a _hash_ as we have to log in everytime with plain text anyways...

##### However feel free to pull request if you're smarter :)
